#FGDES at FAU/LRT

The research group FGDES develops methods for the analysis and synthesis of discrete-event systems with a particular focus on modular and/or hierarchical architectures. Here, discrete-event systems are dynamical systems with a finite-range state variable. Prototypical application domains are so called ‚Äúmen made systems‚Äù, e.g., for automated manufacturing or logistics, which by construction can be adequately represented by discrete-event models.

Since its foundation, FGDES has devopped a number of software toole that facilitate practical experiments in th field of discrete-event systems. Some of these tools have been used by third parties, which is appreciated. To easy external contributions, we are in the progress of moving the source codes to this public repository. Precompiles binaries/executable are still available from the FGDES web site.
